# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project is for me to play around with exercises and ideas.

Currently consists of a FizzBuzz and a Grid section. FizzBuzz is where I play with a FizzBuzz generator and some dynamic grid columns.

The Grid section is for me to get more comfortable with CSS grid. You can try different grid styles and create your own custom grid settings while also being able to manipulate the grid items themselves.
